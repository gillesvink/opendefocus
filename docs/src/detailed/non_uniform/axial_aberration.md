# <i class="fa-solid fa-down-left-and-up-right-to-center"></i> Axial aberration
Axial aberration, or also called *longitudinal aberration* is an artifact that occurs depending on the focus distance. It inverts the chromatic aberration depending on if it is in the near, or far field. Most often this is a combination of purple and green.

## Example image of effect
Notice the aberration that changes depending on the near and far field.

## Why does it occur?
Below is a video that shows the light ray entering the lens. But each light frequency is hitting the focal point at a different angle. This causes the chromatic aberration to change depending on the focus point. Also notice how the light rays inverse in the near field and the far field.


> [!TIP]
> Near field is after the individual lines have collided (closer to the sensor), far field is before they have collided (closer to the lens).

## What does the axial aberration amount knob do?
It sets the angle light rays enters the lens:
